I am a Ph.D. student at The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University focusing on Accessibility and Human-Robot Interactions (HRI). I am advised by Professor [Aaron Steinfeld](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~astein/) and am part of the [Transportation, Bots, and Disability Lab](https://tbd.ri.cmu.edu/). 

I graduated from Colby College in 2023 with a B.A. in Computer Science and Japanese. At Colby, I worked under Professor [Stacy Doore](https://stacyadoore.com/) on robotic guide dogs for the blind. Outside of academics, I was on the varsity swim team and the club rugby team.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
