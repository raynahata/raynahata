I had the pleasure of presenting my research at the **RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP)** in Tokyo, Japan, hosted by **Dr. Mihoko Otake-Matsuura**.  
This seminar was co-hosted by the *Cognitive Behavioral Assistive Technology (CBAT) Team*, RIKEN AIP, and the *Special Interest Group on "Nursing Care Robot"* of the Robotics Society of Japan (SIGNCR-RSJ).
