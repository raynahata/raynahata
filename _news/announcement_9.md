I attended the HAI conference in Yokohama, Japan, where I presented at the [Workshop on Socially Aware and Cooperative Intelligent Systems](https://social-intel-workshop.github.io/2025/) on my most recent work on social exercise coaches for older adults ([short paper](https://social-intel-workshop.github.io/2025/flash_talks/HAI_3/paper.pdf)). I also presented a poster on my prior work, focusing on need finding and early design insights for exercise robots for older adults.
